## Overview

**Factors** that influence the ability of a classifier to identify rare events are:

- Small sample size: Imbalanced classes may not be a problem if the data is big enough
- Class separability: if the classes are linearly separable for e.g, this is not a hard problem
- Within-class imbalance: In some classification problems, a class contains many subclasses; the class is not homogeneous and some subclasses are imbalanced between each others.

Three **approaches** are usually used to tackle imbalanced data: Data approaches, cost-sensitive approaches and ensembling.

## Metrics

## Undersampling

The **Balancing ratio** is the ratio of the minority class to the majority class. Ra

There are two families of methods:

- **Fixed**: reduce the majority class to the same # of observations as the minority class
- **Cleaning**: Clean the majority class based on some criteria

### Random undersampling

This is a na√Øve technique that undersamples the majority class till reaching the balancing ratio that we want. Some problems with this method

- Some majority classes classes might be hard to learn
- The # of samples in a minority class might be very limited and reaching a certain balancing ratio would eliminate so much information about the majority class
