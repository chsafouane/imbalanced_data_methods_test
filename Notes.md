## Overview

**Factors** that influence the ability of a classifier to identify rare events are:

- Small sample size: Imbalanced classes may not be a problem if the data is big enough
- Class separability: if the classes are linearly separable for e.g, this is not a hard problem
- Within-class imbalance: In some classification problems, a class contains many subclasses; the class is not homogeneous and some subclasses are imbalanced between each others.

three **approaches** are usually used to tackle imbalanced data: Data approaches, cost-sensitive approaches and ensembling.
